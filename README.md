# ðŸ“Œ Hi, I'm Sharanya! 
Currently an incoming sophomore at the University of Cincinnati, I'm deeply passionate about the intricate yet extraordinary world of Science & Technology. I love learning about the world and tackling new challenges with enthusiasm, dedication & most importantly, integrity. My commitment to giving my best efforts in every task reflects my sincere approach towards my work, education and professional development. Moreover, I am a firm advocate of teamwork. I believe in the power of unity and the unique contributions each individual brings to a group. Learning from the experiences of others truly enriches my understanding and knowledge.

One of my greatest motivations for pursuing Computer Science in college is that it allows me to blend my technical skills with creativity. To me, this field opens a door full of opportunities, allowing me to design and develop codes, applications, and programs that are products of my own creativity and imagination ðŸ’Œ

Always looking forward to opportunities that allow me to learn, grow and contribute to innovative projects!
